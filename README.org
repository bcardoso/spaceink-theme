** Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package spaceink-theme
  :load-path "/path/to/spaceink-theme"
  :config
  (load-theme 'spaceink t))
#+end_src


** Using colors

The function =spaceink-theme-with-colors= returns the colors of =spaceink-theme-palette= by their label, so you can use it elsewhere. For example, to make specific Org mode tags have a distinct color:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt org-tag-faces
        (spaceink-theme-with-colors
          `(("@work"     . ,red+1)
            ("@home"     . ,orange+1)
            ("@computer" . ,green+1))))
#+end_src


** Export color scheme

In =spaceink-export.el=, there are functions to export the =spaceink= color scheme to other formats.

*** Xresources

The function =spaceink-export-xresources= exports the color scheme to Xresources format.

- [[file:schemes/spaceink-theme.Xresources][spaceink-theme.Xresources]]

If you wish to use =spaceink= colors in the terminal, add the following line at the end of your =~/.Xresources= file:

#+begin_src conf
#include "/path/to/spaceink-theme.Xresources"
#+end_src

And reload the file:

#+begin_src sh
xrdb -load  ~/.Xresources
#+end_src


*** Alacritty

The function =spaceink-export-alacritty= exports the color scheme to [[https://alacritty.org][Alacritty]] terminal configuration format.

- [[file:schemes/spaceink-theme.toml][spaceink-theme.toml]]

To use =spaceink= colors in Alacritty, add an import to your alacritty.toml:

#+begin_src toml
[general]
import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/spaceink-theme.toml"
]
#+end_src


*** Base16

The function =spaceink-export-base16= exports the color scheme to
[[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16][Base16]] format.

- [[file:schemes/spaceink.yaml][spaceink.yaml]]


** Color generator

=spaceink-colors.el= (or =sic=) contains functions for generating the color shades used by =spaceink=.

It depends on [[https://github.com/neeasade/ct.el][ct.el]] or the command-line tool [[https://github.com/sharkdp/pastel][pastel]]. The commands =sic-use-ct-commands= and =sic-use-pastel-commands= define which backend will be used.

This package is *not* required by the theme: it's just the tool I've been using to generate and manipulate colors. The function =sic-adjust= is probably the most useful one, as it returns a given color adjusted by hue, saturation and lightness.


** History

Several years ago, I settled with [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/inkpot-theme][inkpot-theme]] as my preferred theme. It was an early version of the theme, where the colors were hardcoded in faces definitions (there were no color variables).

As I kept tweaking it to my liking, gradually diverging from the original, I felt the need to set the colors variables myself. I then borrowed the main structure and package support from [[https://github.com/bruce/emacs-spacegray-theme][spacegray-theme]], which I also used at the time, to make up my new theme. Hence the name =spaceink=.

For most of the time I used [[https://github.com/sharkdp/pastel][pastel]] to manipulate colors in the terminal. More recently I decided to write the =sic= color generator to not get lost in color commands and transformations while also being able to "reproduce" the same colors again.

=spaceink= has changed a lot over time, but is /somewhat stable/ for the past year or so. That's why I finally decided to publish it :)
